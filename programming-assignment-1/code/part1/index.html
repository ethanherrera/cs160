    </header>
    <main>
      <!-- Add your HTML code here! -->

      <!--
        You can use radio buttons to allow the user to select the currency they want to
        convert from; the browser will automatically only allow one button to be selected
        at once.
        You don't have to use radio buttons, but if you replace radio buttons, you'll want
        some other mechanism for letting the user know which currency they've selected.

          <input type="radio" name="currency" value="usd" id="usd-clickable">
          <input type="radio" name="currency" value="eur" id="eur-clickable">

        Notice that both radio buttons use the same value for the "name" attribute.
        This is how the browser is able to ensure that only one radio button from this
        group is selected at a time.
        <input> is a "void" element, so there's no need to close it with </input>.

        Avoid dropdowns (<select>) for this assignment, because the autograder won't be
        able to find the options to click on.
      -->

      <!--
        <input> takes other "type"s, not just radio. Using "text" shows a textbox, which
        the user can type in:
        
          <input type="text" id="amount-textbox">
      -->

      <!--
        Consider using the <button> element to create a button that the user can use to
        calculate all of the values:
        
          <button id="calculate-clickable">Button text</button>
          
        You can style button elements with CSS to customize them quite a bit!
      -->

      <!--
        You can display the results however you like. Consider using (and styling) a
        table:

          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>USD</th>
                <th>EUR</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td id="usd-calculated"></td>
                <td id="eur-calculated"></td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
      -->

      <!-- 
        For the error message, a <span> or a <div> with the appropriate ID would work.
        You might want to modify the JavaScript code below to show or hide the entire
        element, rather than just changing the text.
      -->

      <!--
        All of the above are just suggestions. Feel free to experiment with other
        elements! You can add styles to anything you add above using CSS in the
        <style> tag up at the top of the file.
      -->
    </main>

    <script>
      const EUR_PER_USD = 0.93;

      // This code grabs the element above with the id "calculate-clickable". This could
      // be a button or any other kind of element.
      const calculateClickable = document.getElementById("calculate-clickable");

      calculateClickable.addEventListener("click", () => {
        // The code in this block runs when the element above is clicked.

        // Now, let's grab the textbox using the required ID:
        const amountTextbox = document.getElementById("amount-textbox");

        // We can get the '.value' attribute of an <input> element; in this case, since it's
        // a textbox, it'll just return the text that the user typed in.
        const amount = amountTextbox.value;

        // To convert to a number, we can use the 'parseFloat' function.
        const amountAsNumber = parseFloat(amount);

        // Write some code to make sure the amount is positive.
        // If it's not, set the content of the error message element:
        document.getElementById("error-message").textContent = ""; // ...
        // Consider also hiding or showing the element:
        //   document.getElementById("error-message").style.display = "none";
        //   document.getElementById("error-message").style.display = "block"; // or "inline", for a span

        // You'll need to think about how you want to calculate the value for each currency.
        // Make sure to take the "from" currency into account. You can tell if a radio button
        // is checked using the '.checked' attribute in JavaScript, which is a boolean true/false value.

        // Once you have the result, you can set the content of each element with the appropriate ID:
        //  document.getElementById("usd-calculated").textContent = ...;
        // If you want to include additional text (e.g. a â‚¬ symbol), you can either include it here
        // or add it in the HTML, outside of the element with the "usd-calculated" ID.
        // To do this, you may want to use a <span> (rather than a <td>) for the "usd-calculated" element.
      });
