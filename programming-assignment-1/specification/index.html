      <p>Welcome to CS 160’s first programming assignment!</p>

      <p>
        By the end of this course, you’ll be designing and implementing
        prototypes of Web applications that solve real problems you discover
        from interviewing target users.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you've built with Web technologies before or you’re just
        starting out, these programming assignments will give you practice
        designed to prepare you for your final project.
      </p>

      <p>In this two-part programming assignment, you will:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Build a currency conversion calculator with HTML, CSS, and a liiittle
          bit of JavaScript
        </li>
        <li>Practice building structured layouts with Flexbox</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Let’s dive in!</p>

      <p>
        Programming assignments should be your own. You are not allowed to copy
        other students code, or copy/modify large chunks of code or entire
        projects found online (e.g. on GitHub).
      </p>

      <p>
        You are allowed to consult online resources, e.g. Stack Overflow, to get
        answers to specific implementation questions.
      </p>

      <p>
        LLM-based tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot are helpful and
        increasingly common in industry, and
        <strong>you may use them</strong> to help you complete assignments, with
        the following caveats:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          You should stick to using AI for line- or function-level edits; do
          <strong>not</strong> paste the entire chunks of the assignment
          description into ChatGPT (it’s pretty obvious when you do this).
          Programming assignments are not quite like real-world software
          development, because we often provide detail in the specification that
          would not normally be written out for you in a real-world project. If
          you use these tools, you should practice the skill of communicating
          with the tools rather than letting the assignment document do this for
          you.
        </li>
        <li>
          We generally describe what we want you to learn from a particular
          exercise. Work through each task with the intention of
          <strong>practicing the skills we mention</strong>; if AI helped you
          get unstuck, do your best to come away with an understanding of the
          concepts targeted by the assignment.
        </li>
        <li>
          When we ask you to think about the design and aesthetics of your
          application,
          <strong>we’re looking for <em>your</em> creative spark</strong>. AI
          can be great for helping you find the right CSS rules to style an
          element, but you should be making your own high-level decisions.
        </li>
        <li>
          The goal of these assignments is to develop your skills to work
          independently on code implementations. LLMs can be part of this
          process, but when you prompt AI tools to help you write assignment
          code,
          <strong>you should not share the exact prompts you used</strong> with
          other students. This has a similar effect as sharing code, since it
          prevents other students from developing their own skills with the
          tools they are using. Of course, it's always okay to exchange
          high-level advice with your peers.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="Starter_code">Starter code</h2>

      <p>
        This assignment includes starter code in the
        <code>code</code> directory. You should build on top of this code for
        your assignment submission.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please do <strong>not</strong> fork the repository on GitHub or upload
        your code anywhere public-facing. Remember, students aren’t allowed to
        directly copy each other’s code for these assignments; if another
        student copies your code, we won’t be able to tell who copied whom, and
        you’ll be on the hook for the plagiarism too!
      </p>

      <h2 id="Submission">Submission</h2>

      <p>
        You will modify the starter code provided to you with the assignment,
        then submit your code as a zip file to Gradescope containing your code
        submission. Gradescope will give you a score for the autogradable
        portions of the assignment, but some portions will be manually graded by
        course staff after the submission deadline.

        <h2>Part 1 · Currency Conversion</h2>
        <p>
          <em> Skills: HTML forms, CSS, JavaScript expressions </em>
        </p>

        <p>
          Open <strong>part1/index.html</strong>. In HTML,
          <code>index.html</code> in a directory typically refers to the “main”
          page, named this way because it represents the page that often acts as
          an “index” or table of contents for the rest of the directory.
        </p>

        <p>
          We’ve given you some skeleton code, but you’ll notice that things are
          pretty bare!
        </p>

        <p>
          Your job is to implement a
          <strong>currency conversion calculator</strong>:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The user chooses a “from” currency (e.g. <strong>USD</strong>) and
            types a value into a text box (e.g. <strong>2.18</strong>)
          </li>
          <li>
            The user clicks a “calculate” button, at which point the currency
            value is converted into all other currencies supported by the
            application and the results are displayed on the screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the user types a negative currency value, rather than showing a
            conversion, an error message is shown to the user.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          You’ll implement four currencies: <strong>USD</strong>,
          <strong>EUR</strong>, and two other currencies of your choice.
        </p>

        <p>
          For USD/EUR, use the following conversion:
          <strong>1 USD = 0.93 EUR</strong>. For the other currencies you
          choose, look up an appropriate conversion to use in your code. The
          autograder will try to figure out the appropriate conversions for
          whatever currency you do choose; try to choose a currency worth around
          the same order of magnitude as USD to avoid rounding errors.
        </p>

        <p>
          You should
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed"
            >round off</a
          >
          the calculated currency values to avoid awkward cases with decimal
          places (e.g. €12.1495327… or $1.4)! The autograder will allow for some
          slop in the results, so it’s okay to round to the hundredths place.
          <!-- Grading note: this is ultimately part of 'aesthetics' -->
        </p>

        <h3>Aesthetics</h3>

        <p>
          The starter code <strong>isn't very pretty</strong>. We haven't put
          much thought into how the page looks; that's your job.
        </p>

        <p>
          Use CSS to change colors, fonts, padding, borders, etc. in your
          calculator to improve its appearance. There is a
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference"
            >lot of flexibility</a
          >
          in how you use CSS, so experiment a bit!
        </p>

        <p>
          We'd like you to
          <strong>choose a design concept or goal</strong> as you decide how the
          calculator should appear. What do you want your user to think about as
          they use your design? How do you want them to feel? This doesn’t have
          to relate to the functional purpose of the application (since we’re
          constraining you to a pretty specific functionality); no need to make
          the calculator bank-themed just because it's a currency converter.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here are some example high-level goals; you can choose one of these if
          it really speaks to you, but try to add a twist!
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>make the user feel cozy</li>
          <li>invoke the aesthetic of a train departure board</li>
          <li>give the vibe of a pushy salesperson</li>
          <li>support efficient use by a power user</li>
          <li><strong>anything else</strong> that comes to mind!</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Whatever idea you settle on, please
          <strong>write it somewhere in the page</strong>, along with a brief
          description of (at least)
          <strong>three concrete styling decisions you made</strong> in support
          of the idea (e.g.
          <em>
            “to give a ‘cramped’ feel, I added a negative
            <code>letter-spacing</code> to the header text” </em
          >).
        </p>

        <div class="admonition-info">
          👋 Hello from your course staff! Seeing your creative decisions — and
          your growth as a designer as you practice these skills — is one of our
          favorite things about teaching this course.

          <p>
            We provide feedback on your designs, and our most thoughtful
            feedback comes when we can see you have put a lot of thought into
            your work. We’d rather see something a little
            <em>experimental</em> that misses the mark than a dull design that
            plays it safe!

            3 points: Improved aesthetics. Include a description in your page of
            your design concept, along with a brief description of at least
            three concrete styling decisions you made in support of the idea.
          </li>
          <li>
            1 point: Sensible layout/interactions. A user should be able to
            approach and use your application without too much struggle. The
            autograder interaction requirements (listed below) will restrict the
            possible space of interactions, but you should still make sure to
            design the application in a way that makes it easy to find the right
            things to click and to find the results of the calculation.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>
          Here’s an interaction with an example implementation of the
          calculator. Note that,
          <strong>aesthetically, it wouldn’t earn full credit</strong>!
        </p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <img
            src="images/part1-example.gif"

          />
        </div>

        <h3 id="Grading_notes">Grading notes</h3>
        <p>
          The autograder uses a testing tool called
          <a href="https://playwright.dev/">Playwright</a> to load your app in a
          web browser (Google’s open source Chromium) and “click” through your
          application to verify its functionality. You’ll be able to observe the
          full trace of each test to see how it worked and, if it failed, what
          caused the failure. For this to work, the autograder needs to be able
          to:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            find your <strong>buttons</strong> and <strong>text field</strong>,
            to simulate a user interacting with the page
          </li>
          <li>
            “read” the output from your application and confirm that it is
            correct
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          When choosing a currency, the autograder will look for elements with
          the following HTML <code>id</code> attribute for clicking:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            To set which currency we’re calculating <strong>from</strong>,
            <ul>
              <li><code>usd-clickable</code></li>
              <li><code>eur-clickable</code></li>
              <li><code>custom-currency-1-clickable</code></li>
              <li><code>custom-currency-2-clickable</code></li>
              <li>
                (note: you should use the literal ID
                <code>custom-currency-1-clickable</code>,
                <strong>not</strong> e.g. <code>gbp-clickable</code> or whatever
                currency you're converting to.)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            To find the text box to type into,
            <ul>
              <li><code>amount-textbox</code></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            And to actually do the calculation:
            <ul>
              <li><code>calculate-clickable</code></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          To create an HTML element with the appropriate ID, you might write
          something like this:
          <code>&lt;input type="radio" id="usd-clickable" ...&gt;</code>
          <code>&lt;button id="calculate-clickable"&gt;&lt;/button&gt;</code>
        </p>

        <p>
          (Note that you don’t necessarily need to use radio/button elements!
          See the comments in the starter code for some details on your
          options.) In addition, when looking to see if you are outputting the
          correct calculation results, the autograder will look for a number in
          each of the following elements (again, using the
          <code>id</code> attribute):
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><code>usd-calculated</code></li>
          <li><code>eur-calculated</code></li>
          <li><code>custom-currency-1-calculated</code></li>
          <li><code>custom-currency-2-calculated</code></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          And if you are displaying an error to the user, you should put some
          text in an element that has this ID. Otherwise, this element should be
          empty:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><code>error-message</code></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Since you’ll need to use some JavaScript code (much of which is
          written for you) to respond to mouse clicks and update the page, these
          IDs will also be handy to reference elements in the page for the
          JavaScript code.
        </p>

        <h3>Reading an autograder trace</h3>

        <p>
          When you submit to Gradescope, each autograder test will output a link
          to a trace where you can view the test run:
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
          <img
            src="images/part1-gradescope.png"
            alt="Screenshot of a passed and a failed test in Gradescope"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          At the bottom of the linked page, you can click on “Traces” to see an
          interactive explorer of the test run:
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
          <img
            src="images/part1-traces-thumb.png"
            alt="Screenshot of the link to the Trace page in Playwright"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          You can scrub along the top of the screen or the list of actions on
          the left to see the progression of the test run, including markers
          where the autograder clicked on or read elements of the page:
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
          <img
            src="images/part1-trace.png"
            alt="Screenshot of a test trace in Playwright"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          Note that, if the test framework fails to find an element (say,
          because you haven’t added it to the page at all), you’ll typically see
          this in the autograder as a test <strong>timeout</strong>. Playwright
          is waiting to see if the element will “pop into” the page later, and
          once it has waited long enough, it eventually decides that it’s never
          going to find the missing element and fails the test.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Skills: Flexbox, Media queries</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Use Flexbox</strong> to recreate each of the following layouts
          in the HTML files located in the <strong>part2</strong> directory.
        </p>

        <p>
          All layouts should be <strong>responsive</strong>: they should
          <strong>keep the same proportions</strong> when the browser window is
          resized (e.g., should maintain proportions in the horizontal direction
          when the browser is widened, and should maintain proportions in the
          vertical direction when the browser is lengthened).
        </p>

        <div class="admonition-danger">
          Do not use <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, or
          <code>float</code> to arrange elements in these layouts. We want you
          to practice using Flexbox’s sizing and alignment properties, so the
          autograder will forbid the use of these properties.
        </div>

        <div class="admonition-warning">
          If you have vision-related disabilities and are not able to view the
          images below, please reach out to course staff so we can help you
          practice these skills; the autograder for this task does require
          precise visual positioning that matches the screenshots.
        </div>

        <h3>Layout A</h3>
        <p>
          Create this layout in the template file. You will find that the
          <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tag is styled to fill the whole document.
          Add three <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s to the HTML, styling them
          appropriately within the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag, to construct
          this layout.
        </p>
        <div class="left-right">
          <div class="image-container no-ornamentation">
            <img
              src="images/part2-layoutA1.png"
              alt="Layout A: three vertical columns filling the whole screen"
            />
          </div>
          <div class="image-container no-ornamentation">
            <img
              src="images/part2-layoutA2.png"
              alt="Layout A, but at a different aspect ratio"
            />
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="caption">
          This is the same page, just with the browser resized. Make sure this
          proportional resize works in yours, too!
        </div>
        <p>
          From left to right, the background colors of the elements are red,
          blue, and green.
        </p>
        <p>
          To add the appropriate background color to a particular div, use the
          class <strong>red</strong>, <strong>blue</strong>, or
          <strong>green</strong>. The classes <strong>yellow</strong> and
          <strong>gray</strong> will be used later. You can color the
          <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s using a different technique if you need to,
          but please make sure the colors match the colors from the starter code
          exactly so that the autograder can look at your layouts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hint: since the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s you make will not contain
          any content, you need to explicitly tell them to
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex"
            >grow to fill the flex container</a
          >.
        </p>

        <h3>Layout B</h3>
        <p>
          Now, make this layout. You will need five differently-colored
          <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s, and may use extra containing
          <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s for structure, if you need.
        </p>
        <div class="left-right">
          <div class="image-container no-ornamentation">
            <img
              src="images/part2-layoutB1.png"
              alt="Layout B: a left column filling 50% of the screen width with two equally-sized rows, and a right column filling the remaining 50% of the screen width with three equally-sized rows"
            />
          </div>
          <div class="image-container no-ornamentation">
            <img
              src="images/part2-layoutB2.png"
              alt="Layout B, but at a different aspect ratio"
            />
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="caption">
          Again, this is two distinct views of the same page, with the browser
          resized. You only need to make it once.
        </div>
        <p>
          The left column takes up half of the screen width and is divided into
          two rows of the same height (red on top, blue on bottom). The right
          column is divided into three equal-height rows (green, yellow, and
          gray, top-to-bottom).
        </p>

        <h3>Layout C</h3>
        <p>
          Create this grid layout. The top row is twice as tall as the bottom
          row. The quadrant colors are: top left, red; top right, blue; bottom
          left, green; bottom right, yellow.
        </p>
        <div class="left-right">
          <div class="image-container no-ornamentation">
            <img src="images/part2-layoutC1.png" alt="Layout C: a 2x2 grid" />
          </div>
          <div class="image-container no-ornamentation">
            <img
              src="images/part2-layoutC2.png"
              alt="Layout C, but at a different aspect ratio"
            />
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Layout D</h3>
        <p>
          This one’s a little trickier! You can add whatever
          <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s you need around the circles, but you’ll also
          need the six <code>&lt;div class="circle"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>s
          we’ve included for you. Don’t add, remove, or change these
          <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s.
        </p>
        <div class="left-right">
          <div class="image-container no-ornamentation">
            <img
              src="images/part2-layoutD1.png"
              alt="Layout D, described below"
            />
          </div>
          <div class="image-container no-ornamentation">
            <img
              src="images/part2-layoutD2.png"
              alt="Layout D, but at a different aspect ratio"
            />
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          The top row, with a red background, is one-third the total height. It
          contains three circles, centered horizontally and vertically, with no
          space in between. The bottom row, with a blue background, has circles
          that are centered horizontally and positioned vertically, spaced as
          shown (so that the space in between the circles is equal to the space
          above the top circle and below the bottom circle).
        </p>

        <h3>Layout E</h3>
        <p>
          Use
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries"
            >media queries</a
          >
          to apply <strong>different</strong> styling rules depending on whether
          the browser window is in portrait or landscape orientation. The HTML
          should be the same for both orientations (and you won’t need any
          JavaScript).
        </p>
        <div class="left-right">
          <div class="image-container no-ornamentation">
            <img
              src="images/part2-layoutE1.png"
              alt="Layout E portrait: four solid bars in rows"
            />
          </div>
          <div class="image-container no-ornamentation">
            <img
              src="images/part2-layoutE2.png"
              alt="Layout E landscape: four solid bars in columns"
            />
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          From top-to-bottom in portrait mode or left-to-right in landscape
          mode, the colors are red, blue, green, and yellow.
        </p>

        <h3>Scoring (8 points)</h3>
        <p>
          2 points per layout. Ten points are available; you’re welcome to skip
          a layout if you’re having trouble, as long as you’ve finished the
          other four. If you complete all five layouts to satisfaction, you’ll
          earn a 10/8 on this section, which can serve as a buffer for other
          parts of your assignment grade. The assignment as a whole will still
          be capped at 20/20 points.
        </p>
        <p>
          The autograder takes a screenshot of each screen and compares it
          against an expected reference screenshot. The autograder will test
          each layout in multiple browser viewport sizes. Since the runtime
          environment is consistent, you should be able to get pixel-perfect
          accuracy if you implement these correctly. Remember to read each
          specification carefully!
